      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>
        Welcome to my website! It's currently being developed so please. Don't
        hate it too much. I'm a very new coder (haven't made a website in about
        6 years or so) and i have forgotten it all. So please. This is a
        refresher for me! If you wish to give me a hand, that would be awesome!
        :D
      </p>

      The only ones are working are in the Navbar for Frigate Class, nothing
      else works right now.
      <p></p>
      Warning! This website is in Dev mode so LITTLE progess will be given, It's
      being made by someone with barely any knowledge on Html, php and java.
