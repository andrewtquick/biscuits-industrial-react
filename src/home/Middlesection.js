        <h1>Welcome</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my website! It's currently being developed so please. Don't hate it too much. I'm a very new coder (haven't made a website in about 6 years or so) and i have forgotten it all. So please. This is a refresher for me! If you wish to give me a hand, that would be awesome! :D</p>
        <p></p>
            The only ones are working are in the Navbar for Frigate Class, nothing else works right now.
        <p></p>
